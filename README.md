LoadLeveller is a framework for developing high-performance, distributed (quantum) Monte Carlo codes.
Its aim is to abstract away model independent boilerplate such as error analysis, checkpointing, and scheduling. The core
design philosophies are:

* Keep it simple!
* Avoid surprises
* Promote good research data management
